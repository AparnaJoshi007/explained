## COVID-19: Facts and figures.
Coronavirus disease ü¶†is an infectious upper respiratory disease caused by [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) virus. Mostly commonly known as Coronavirus, this disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. Within mere months of its first discovery, COVID-19 has spread all over the world, causing it to become a global pandemic, claiming 200000 lives. This article paints a brief picture of how this disease came to be, and what the current situation is?

## A species barrier was crossedüöß:
**December 2019**, For the microbes, it was the day to celebrate, as the Coronaviruses had crossed a new species barrier. They had mutated such that they could now infect the human hosts. Unlike many organisms, the main goal of the viruses is to find a host body, infect, and use their cell's structure to reproduce. The same would be the goals of this newfound COVID-19 virus. Some speculate that it mutated through bats, others say it had infected some other form of life stock in Wuhan market, however, the concrete truth is that these viruses had mutated themselves to have a human host.

The Coronaviruses started spreading amongst the residents of Wuhan district like a forest fire. This was when international travel was still at its peak. Before the China government could confirm its existence and declare this new disease to be an Epidemic in the Hubei province, the viruses had found its hosts from across the world. 

**The Coronaviruses had already won the first stage of the battle for 2 reasons:**
- Since this is a new virus, humans knew relatively lesser information about the virus. Every virus contains some kind of genetic information either in the form of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) or [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA), covered in a protein coating. The rate at which the virus can spread, and the amount of time viruses can live outside the host cell differs from one virus to another. None of this information was clear at the beginning.
- The Coronaviruses had an incubation period(how long the viruses reside in the human body until the person starts showing visible symptoms), and the spread had happened worldwide before these details could be validated and confirmed.

## The careless attitude ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è of citizens caused the exponential spread of the viruses

The Coronaviruses are extremely contagious. The viruses spread not only through direct contact with the infected person, but also by respiratory droplets left behind in the air, and through surface contamination. At the beginning of 2020, China's Hubei province had 1000s of infected cases and was under complete lockdown, rest of the world, however, had very few cases of Coronavirus and let the international travel continue. Airports and other public areas had fewer restrictions for people traveling to/from other areas, little did we know that this would be the main cause of the rapid spread of the Virus.

After a couple of months, the stages of COVID-19 spread was narrowed down to 4 stages:

> - Stage 1Ô∏è‚É£: The disease isn't spread locally. Only the people with travel history to an already infected country are affected.
> - Stage 2Ô∏è‚É£: The disease starts spreading locally by coming in contact with infected individuals.
> - Stage 3Ô∏è‚É£: The area starts having community spread. This is the stage when infected individuals cannot be traced back to their hosts.
> - Stage 4Ô∏è‚É£: The spread of the disease is so high that it is uncontrollable and the country/area starts showing major clusters of injections.


## Historical data üìä to the rescue

Coronavirus is not the first-ever pandemic the world had faced. We have the ancient and vicious [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) pandemic, [Small Pox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox) widespread which was finally eradicated in the 1900s. [Spanish flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) which claimed the lives of near 50million people. The most recent outbreaks include [Ebola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease), [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) and [MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome). The COVID-19 is mostly being compared with SARS and MERS since these viruses come from the same family, and also display similar characteristics. 

![Comparision](/images/coronavirus-pandemic/comparision.png)

However, care should be taken to understand that COVID-19 is very different from previously seen SARS and MERS. Current studies show that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is around 7%, compared to 9.43% of SARS, and a lot less than the 34.5% mortality rate of MERS. It is important to note that, the spread of COVID-19 is very high, due to which there would be more number of infected individuals, leading to more number of deaths across the world, even with a lesser percentage of mortality rates.

## Panic üò± among the individuals due to lockdown: Side-effects of a global crisis

Within the first few months of its origin, CoronaVirus became a global pandemic. Initially, with a lesser number of cases, the mortality rate seemed to be quite low, around 2%. However, as the disease began to spread like a wildfire, it has been noticed that the mortality rate is much higher among individuals with age greater than 50. 

- The initial stage of panic began when the countries across the world started banning the air travels to and from China. This led to more air travels as people wanted to come back to their hometowns before there would be a complete lockdown, aiding to the spread of the disease internationally.
- The next stage of panic included a high number of individuals trying to buy surgical masks in the hopes of evading the virus. This caused a sudden surge in the prices, also a shortage of masks in the hospitals where actual patients reside. A wrong move due to panic which did more harm than good.

- The third stage of panic was caused due to lockdown enforcements. People all over the world hurried to supermarkets and grocery stores to stock up their supplies and essentials, causing the weaker section of society such as senior-citizens to suffer.

- The final ongoing crisis includes major declines in the sales and profits of many companies across various sectors. Transportation, Entertainment, Hotels, and Restaurants are some of the sectors being hit badly, leading to thousands of individuals losing their jobs. This doesn't even compare to the plight of the daily-wage workers.

Governments across the globe are putting in their best efforts to help the people who are the indirect victims of this pandemic. However, this will be more successful if every individual joined hands with the government and the healthcare system in the prevention of the disease.

## Social distancing is the new cool ‚õÑ: Looking at the bright-side of pandemic 

The pandemic is bad for everyone, whether we are directly infected with the disease, or we are sitting safely at home, it is still affecting us. However, there is still a subtle bright side to this situation.

1. Countries across the world are helping each other in research and development of new vaccine/cure to this disease. This may lead to a stronger and long-lasting collaboration among the healthcare systems of the world.
2. We have come to realize that the most essential thing is having good health, some food on the plate, and a roof on our heads. Even the sales of iPhones üì± are stopped due to pandemic.
3. Wars of any kind, are not essential. Peaceful co-existence and collaboration is the way to move forward.

4. Nature has an immense potential to heal itself, as long as we humans give it a break. While staying at home and social distancing has been dreadful to us, it's become a boon to many life forms, including the earth itself. With pollution levels decreased both in air and water, we can see mountains ‚õ∞Ô∏è from far away, penguins and ducks üêß are swimming freely in places where they were never known to exist before. The birds chirping has increased in the urban areas in recent days. Summer üåû is not as hot as it was expected to be.

I conclude this article with the hopes that humanity doesn't forget the lessons learned due to the COVID-19 crisis. Giving the whole world, and ourselves a break doesn't seem so bad.
