# Explained

Built with Gatsby starter, explained is a personal/hobby blog I have created to talk and write about my interests.

## How can I use Gatsby to create my own blog?

If you are a newcomer to Gatsby who's interested in the implementations of most needed features, this is a great place to start.

If you are interested in a foundation for building ultra-fast websites, you can use this project as a "minimal" starter.
